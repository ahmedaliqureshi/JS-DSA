//Q) we are going to check which number is the largest among the 
// 3

//so we are going to declare a 3 variabel by use of let and then 
// we are goin to assign them a value 

let a=12455
let b=12456
let c=1278

//then we are going to declare if else condition to check 

if(a>b&&a>c)
    console.log(`${a} is greater then ${b} and ${c}`);
else if(b>a&&b>c)
    console.log(`${b} is greater then ${a} and ${c}`); 
else 
    console.log(`${c} is greatest`);
