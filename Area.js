//Q) to calculate the area of the triangle, there are mainly 
//2 ways to do it
// 1st:- use of 1/2*(Height+Base);
// 2nd:- use of 3 seides by s*s*s ;

//1st method:-
// for height be h
let h=2;
//for base be b
let b=6;
//to calculate the area, just sub the formula into a
// variable
let A= 1/2*(h*b);
//print the value
console.log(A);

//2nd method:-
//declare a sides
let s1=2;
let s2=2;
let s3=2;
//to calculate the area, just multiply the sides, just sub 
//formula inot the varibale
let S=s1*s2*s3; 
//print the output 
console.log(S);
